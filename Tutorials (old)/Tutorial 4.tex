% Given the examples in (\ref{believe_consider}):
% \begin{exe}
%     \ex{
%     \begin{xlist}
%         \ex{I believe those people to know the answer.}
%         \label{believe}
%         \ex{I consider their proposal to be ridiculous.}
%     \end{xlist}
%     }
%     \label{believe_consider}
% \end{exe}
% Here are two hypotheses, \ref{hyp_A} \& \ref{hyp_B}, about the behaviour of \emph{believe} and \emph{consider}:
% \begin{xlistA}
%     \ex[]{%\textbf{Hypothesis A}\\
%     These verbs have two arguments: a \iibar{D} subject argument and an infinitival \iibar{I} object argument.
%     These verbs are able to assign \keyword{accusative} case in an \textsc{exceptional} way, to the \iibar{D} occupying the specifier position of that infinitival \iibar{I} complement.
%     So the structure of (\ref{believe}) is roughly:\\ I believe \lbrack{}\textsubscript{\iibar{I}} \lbrack{}\textsubscript{\iibar{D}}those people\rbrack{}\textsubscript{\Acc{}} to know the answer\rbrack{}.
%     }
%     \label{hyp_A}
%     \ex[]{%\textbf{Hypothesis B}\\
%     These verbs have three arguments: a \iibar{D} subject argument, a \iibar{D} object argument, and an infinitival \iibar{I} second object argument.
%     The subject of the infinitival \iibar{I} is a \keyword{pro} whose reference is controlled by the \keyword{accusative} object in the main clause.
%     So the structure of (\ref{believe}) is roughly:\\ I believe \lbrack{}\textsubscript{\iibar{D}} those people\rbrack{}\textsubscript{\Acc{}} \lbrack{}\textsubscript{\iibar{I}} \textsc{pro} to know the answer\rbrack{}.
%     }
%     \label{hyp_B}
% \end{xlistA}
% Some of the following examples are consistent with either hypothesis, and some may support one over the other.
% Which of the examples can be used as an argument to support one hypothesis over the other, and which are “neutral” between the two hypotheses?
% \begin{exe}
%     \ex{
%     \begin{xlist}
%         \ex[*]{I believe they to know the answer.}
%         \ex[]{I believe there to be a good solution.}
%         \ex[]{I believe the answer to be known by those people.}
%         \label{A_case_tree}
%         \ex[]{They are believed to know the answer.}
%         \ex[]{There is believed to be a good solution.}
%         \ex[]{I believe the cat to be out of the bag. (with the interpretation: \emph{I believe that the secret has been exposed})}
%     \end{xlist}
%     }
% \end{exe}
% Write a short response to justify your answer.
% In your answer, draw two possible trees for (\ref{A_case_tree})---one implementing each hypothesis---and provide an accompanying rationale for choosing one over the other.

Instructions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide an analysis (syntactic tree) for each of the following sentences, consistent with the course and represent this in tree form.
    \item You should represent all relevant forms of movement discussed in the course.
    \item Each sentence is tagged with the main Syntax Skills it relies on.
    \item These sentences are complex, synthesising everything we've worked on so far. But this also means that you should be able to separate the parts (skills) you're comfortable with from the ones you're not yet proficient in. In other words, do give all three a try!
    \item If you're still ``missing'' a Syntax Skill from a previous week and believe your tree demonstrates it, include a very brief note (1--2 sentences) after your tree.
    \item If you want to add some explanations about any of your trees, please keep them short too (e.g.~2--3 sentences or a constituency test).
\end{itemize}

The sentences!
\begin{exe}
    \ex[]{Whose bag did you try to steal? \label{whose_bag} \hfill \ref{np_dp} $\Box$, \ref{raising_control} $\Box$, \ref{passives} $\Box$, \ref{wh_movement} $\Box$}
    \ex[]{Dr Ali seems to forget which bag her instruments were put in.\label{which_bag} \hfill \ref{raising_control} $\Box$, \ref{A_movement} $\Box$, \ref{passives} $\Box$, \ref{wh_movement} $\Box$}
    \ex[]{Which stories about the pandemic did the historian consider writing an analysis of? \\
