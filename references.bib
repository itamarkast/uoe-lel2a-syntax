Helps students develop their thinking and argumentation skills rather than merely introducing them to one particular version of syntactic theory. Structured around a wide range of exercises that use clear and compelling logic to build arguments and lead up to theoretical proposals. Data drawn from current media sources, including newspapers, books, and television programs, to help students formulate and test hypotheses. Generative in spirit, but does not focus on specific theoretical approaches but enables students to understand and evaluate different approaches more easily. Written by an established author with an international reputation.},

	abstract = {In a 1982 paper in the journal Glossa, Pullum outlined a set of arguments for treating English infinitival to as a defective auxiliary verb. Twenty years later, in his entry on infinitival constructions in The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language ({CGEL}, 2002), Huddleston argues that several distributional facts about auxiliaries fit poorly with this hypothesis. He proposes, on the basis of significant structural parallels, that to is a subordinator (complementizer). I show that Huddleston's arguments constitute a flawed analysis in {CGEUs} otherwise superb coverage of English descriptive grammar, and that the facts run strongly counter to his claims, often falling out independently from generalizations about auxiliaries that Huddleston overlooks. Several of these points were anticipated in Pullum's paper, but recent research on an idiosyncratic auxiliary-specific pattern of English nonrestrictive relative clause formation provides a powerful new argument in support of the auxiliary claim. In this respect, as in all others, the assignment of to to the class of auxiliaries provides the simplest and broadest account of its syntactic behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an account of sociolinguisticâ€“syntactic variation in Indian English. It focuses on the differences between Standard Indian English ({SIE}) and Indian Vernacular English ({IVE}), restricting the discussion to the syntax of wh-questions, Focus constructions, null subjects and objects (pro drop), and null expletive subjects. The major claim of this paper is that the differences between the observed patterns of generalization in {SIE} and {IVE} are best accounted for in a conceptualization of grammar that is based on a general notion of priority of syntactic constraints on well-formedness. This optimality-theoretic ({OT}) conceptualization (Grimshaw, 1997; Prince \& Smolensky, 1993) is able to capture the following generalizations: (a) {IVE} is just as systematic and logical as {SIE}; (b) the grammars of {IVE} and {SIE} are bound by the same set of grammatical constraints; and (c) the differences between the two varieties is a function of how each grammar prioritizes these constraints. This paper thus also presents a strong argument for using {OT} as a framework for research on language variation and use.},
