    So far:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Verbs are the lexical core of a clause.
        \item But sometimes there are other morphemes around them them, like auxiliaries and agreement.
        \item So we've hypothesised the head (projection) \obar{I}.
    \end{enumerate}

    Today:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The same for nouns. \hfill [7a]
        \item And then we can make sense of the difference between arguments and adjuncts in the same way. \hfill [7b]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Parallels between verbal and nominal versions (c-selection).
        \item No subject requirement in nominals (no expletive subjects needed).
        \item The definite article and the possessor are in complementary distribution.

    What's the difference between Taylor's reliance and Taylor's hat?

    \ea Taylor's reliance on her fans.
    \ex Taylor's hat on the hanger.

\bigskip
    Which is the argument and which is the adjunct?

\bigskip
    How can we express this in our structures?
