        \ea[]{Taylor considered her options.}
        \ex[]{Taylor considered that her fans would be upset.}
        \ex[]{Taylor relied on her fans.}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Parallels between verbal and nominal versions (c-selection).
        \item No subject requirement in nominals (no expletive subjects needed).
        \item The definite article and the possessor are in complementary distribution.

    What's the difference between Taylor's reliance and Taylor's hat? (two structures)

    \ea Taylor's reliance on her fans.
    \ex Taylor's hat on the hanger.
