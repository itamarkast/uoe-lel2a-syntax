\frame{\frametitle{The X-bar schema}
    So far we've established that:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Predicates (verbs) always take a certain set of arguments (noun phrases, clauses, etc). \hfill [4a]
            \item These arguments have different semantic roles (Agent, Patient, etc). \hfill [3b]
            \item We can also add a potentially unlimited number of modifiers (adverbs, etc). \hfill [4b]
        \end{itemize}

\bigskip
    So: how do we put arguments [5a] and adjuncts [5b] into a precise formal system?

\bigskip
    (Later in this block, and then definitely in LEL2D and Hons courses: what \emph{predictions} does the formal system make?)

\frame{\frametitle{The X-bar schema}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A given head might select for its argument.
        \item A given head might also need an additional argument, e.g.~the subject/Agent of a verb.
        \item The X-bar schema: head, complement, specifier.
        \item Modifiers extend the projection.
    \end{enumerate}

\bigskip
    Important:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We've already said all of these things; now we'll get more precise with the terminology and formalism.
        \item Take your time with the formal aspects; they're just one way to represent our understanding and intuitions.
    \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{The X-bar schema}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On the left: the schema (for a verb with subject and object).
        \item Then two examples of it in action.
        \item Pick out the: heads, arguments, complements, specifiers.
    \end{itemize}

        [\obar{V}] [complement]]

    Even more general form:

    \begin{forest} for tree={calign=fixed edge angles},
        [\iibar{X}
        [specifier] [\ibar{X}
        [\obar{X}] [complement]]

\frame{
    The specifier and complement are both phrases.
    
\bigskip
    Why?

\bigskip
    Because we think in terms of \textbf{constituents}, satisfying the projection principle.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item These are technical points: ``do things this way''.

    Some things we haven't talked about yet: adjectives, adverbs, more kinds of verbs, \dots{}

\frame{
    Let's talk about adverbs.

\bigskip
    Adjectives will wait a bit till we develop the structure of NPs a bit more.

\bigskip
    Recap: what's the difference between adverbs and arguments?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Optional.
        \item Pattern differently (we have diagnostics for them).

    Modifiers in our theory: \textbf{adjunction} to the \textbf{bar-level}.

    \ea Dogs really like pats.
    \ex Students draw trees diligently.
    \z

\frame{
    And there are a couple of twists in the following examples (see the lecture notes).

    Auxiliary verb:
    \ea I might draw trees slowly.
    \z
\bigskip

    Where does each of the two modifiers adjoin?
    \ea Dogs really like pats behind the ear.
    \z
