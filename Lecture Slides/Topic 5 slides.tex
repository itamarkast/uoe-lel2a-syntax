\frame{\frametitle{The X-bar schema}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A given head might select for its argument.
        \item A given head might also need an additional argument, e.g.~the subject/Agent of a verb.
        \item The X-bar schema: head, complement, specifier.
    \end{enumerate}

\frame{
    The specifier and complement are both phrases.
    
\bigskip
    Why?

\bigskip
    Because we think in terms of \textbf{constituents}, satisfying the projection principle.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item These are technical points: ``do things this way''.
        \item \textbf{But} they're supposed to show our understanding of syntactic relationships.
        \item Try to keep both of these aspects in mind.
    \end{itemize}

\bigskip
    Some things we haven't talked about yet: adjectives, adverbs, more kinds of verbs, \dots{}
}

\frame{
    Let's talk about adverbs.

\bigskip
    Adjectives will wait a bit till we develop the structure of NPs a bit more.

\bigskip
    Recap: what's the difference between adverbs and arguments?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Optional.
        \item Pattern differently (we have diagnostics for them).

\frame{
    Modifiers in our theory: \textbf{adjunction} to the \textbf{bar-level}.

    \ea Dogs really like pats.
    \ex Students draw trees diligently.

    A couple of twists in the following examples:

    \ea I might draw trees slowly.
    \ex Dogs really like pats behind the ear.
