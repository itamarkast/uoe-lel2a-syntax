    \begin{itemize}
        \item[9a]{Identify non-finite clauses headed by infinitival \emph{to} in a principled way.}

    The plan for our final week:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Topic 10: more control/raising
            \item Topic 11: passives
            \item Topic 12: \emph{wh}-questions
        \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Topic 10}
   \begin{block}{Topic 10 skills}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[10a]{Motivate raising to subject position (A-movement) in terms of either Case or the EPP.}
        \item[10b]{\sout{Analyse instances of object control in a way that is consistent with the framework developed.}}
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    Research Skills:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[M1]{State a hypothesis clearly}
    \item[M2]{Present data in support of a hypothesis}
    \item[M3]{Define the conditions under which a hypothesis would be refuted}
    \item[M4]{Present data to refute a hypothesis}
    \item[M5]{Consider the limitations of a diagnostic test when interpreting the results}
    \end{itemize}
}

    Verb classes for our exercise:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Class 1: %subj control
        \emph{try, hope, want, start, stop, \dots{}}
    \item Class 2: %obj control
        \emph{convince, persuade, tell, \dots{}}
    % \item Class 3: %ambig
        % \emph{promise, ask, \dots{}}
    \item Class 3: %ECM
        \emph{believe, consider, want, expect, allow, \dots{}}
    \item Class 4: %raising
        \emph{seem, appear, eager, start, stop, \dots{}}
    \end{enumerate}

    Construct examples and apply the following tests:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Idioms
        \item Expletive subjects
        \item Agent-oriented adverbs
        \item Passivised subjects
    \end{itemize}
    See if you can draw trees for the examples you came up with. What decisions do you have to make?
        % I believe DP to IP
    % I believe expletive to IP

    The subject requirement (raising):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Case.
            \item EPP requirement on \obar{I}.
        \end{itemize}

        \item Differences between Object Control and ECM.
        \item Ambiguous control/raising verbs like \emph{start, stop}.
