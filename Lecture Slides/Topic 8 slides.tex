    Let's enumerate the differences (and similarities) between the active and passive variants of the same basic clause:

    \bigskip
    \ea
        \ea Billie launched a new perfume.
        \ex A new perfume was launched (by Billie).
        \z
    \z

    \pause
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Same selectional restrictions.
        \item Promotion of object to derived subject.
        \item Optional Agent (or in \emph{by}-phrase).
        \item Passive auxiliary and participial marking.
    \end{enumerate}
