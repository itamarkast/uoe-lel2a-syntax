Here's a \emph{wh}-question in Bulgarian. What's remarkable about it when compared to its English translation?
\ea[]{\gll Koj kude udari Ivan?\\
         who where hit Ivan \\
         \trans `Who hit Ivan where?'}
\z

Interestingly, we can't swap the order of the two \emph{wh}-phrases, even though the meaning would've still been the same. Why might that be?
\ea[*]{\gll Kude koj kude udari Ivan?\\
         where who hit Ivan \\
         \trans (intended: `Who hit Ivan where?')}
\z
